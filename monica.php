              ">Monica was born April 22, 1969. Monica is Ross' younger sister, and the daughter of Jack and Judy Geller. Monica, like the rest of her family, is Jewish. She had a slightly difficult childhood from Ross, characterized by the bickering which took place between her and her brother (some culminating in memorable events such as the Geller Cup, which took place every Thanksgiving). She also had, and still has, a difficult relationship with her parents (especially with her mother) who unconsciously favors Ross over her on various occasions and usually cares about him more than Monica. (Her father did try to fix this by giving her his Porsche in "The One Where Rosita Dies").


High school was a difficult time for Monica, who gained a substantial amount of weight and peaked at 255 pounds. She had few friends; her best friend being Rachel Greene. For prom, she even had a date: Roy Gublik. Her first kiss, however, was (by accident) with her brother, Ross.[9] She met Chandler Bing at her parents' house on Thanksgiving 1987. She initially had a crush on him (and even became a chef because he told her that he liked her macaroni and cheese) until she overheard him referring to her as Ross' "fat sister." The shock was so great for her that she became determined to lose all her extra weight by the next time he would see her. She accomplished this goal by Thanksgiving 1988.[10] She unintentionally got back at him by dropping a knife and severing one of his toes during a failed attempt to get him naked and seduce him.

After college, Monica pursued a life in New York as a chef at Iridium. She also lived with Phoebe Buffay, across the hall from Chandler. Phoebe later moved out because she was worried that their friendship would suffer due to Monica's obsessive tidiness. She had a crush on Joey Tribbiani when he first moved in with Chandler, although he repelled her by stripping naked in her apartment when she offered some lemonade the day they met.
