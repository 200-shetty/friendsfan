              ">Rachel Karen Greene was born to wealthy parents, Leonard and Sandra Greene, who gave her and her two sisters Jill and Amy a rather spoiled upbringing, resulting in them not being able to be independent from their parents financially at first. Rachel originally had a big nose but she later got a nose job. She met Monica Geller for the first time when they were both six years old. They quickly became best friends, remaining exactly like that from then, and the friendship flourished by attending the same high school. Rachel also soon met Monica's older brother, Ross, who developed a crush on her which he decided to keep to himself, although years later Rachel admitted she knew about his crush. Ross knew she would have rejected him and she did, as shown in the Pilot when Rachel thought her was just 'Monica's geeky older brother'.

She was also involved with a popular fellow high school student named Chip, who arrived late to take her out to the high school prom. When it appeared that Chip was never going to arrive, Ross, after being encouraged by his parents Jack and Judy, decided to ask her out himself. Later he missed his chance when Chip arrived before he could ask her. She soon learned how unpleasant, careless and unfaithful at his core Chip was when he ditched her at the prom to have sex with another girl named Amy Welsh, leaving Rachel embarrassed and alone without a date.

Rachel herself was a bully to an overweight student named Will Colbert. In high school she was very popular and a mean girl. Ross dealt with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her in a very immature way. Ross, Will and a foreign student formed an I Hate Rachel Greene Club. They spread a rumor about her, saying that she "had both male and female reproductive parts" and that "her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl" which everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard. Chandler heard the rumor in his high school about a "hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island" however he didn't know it was Rachel.


Rachel with Chandler, Ross, and Monica on Thanksgiving.

During Thanksgiving of 1987, at Monica's house, Rachel arrives very distraught, and she tells Monica that Chip broke up with her for Nancy Branson, and she tells Monica that she is never going out with Chip again, no matter what. Rachel then goes on to say that she is done with high school boys in general, and that she is going to start dating men. Later on, Rachel excitedly tells Monica that Chip dumped Nancy, and that he wants to come over to her house tonight.

On Thanksgiving of 1988, it is revealed that Rachel changed her college major again because there was no parking by the psychology building. Rachel got a nose job. Later on in the kitchen, Rachel teaches Monica 'How to be sexy' so that Monica can get back at Chandler for calling her fat the year before.


Rachel has a fantasy about Chandler, not long after getting engaged to Barry.

One year before the events of the Friends Pilot, Rachel goes out with her friends, celebrating being engaged. However, Rachel is shown to be very nervous about being with Barry for life, and she tells them that she just wants one more fling before she gets married. Chandler, having heard this from behind them, drops a pool ball in hopes to get her attention. However, Rachel just ignores him. Monica then recognizes Rachel, and they hug, and talk a little bit. As their conversation comes to a close, Rachel asks Monica if they can have lunch the next time she is in the city, and Monica agrees. Later on, when Rachel is driving home with her friends, she has a fantasy about Chandler, furthering her concerns about marrying Barry.
