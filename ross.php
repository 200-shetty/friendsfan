     In college, he met Chandler, and they became best friends.<br>
     Chandler met Monica and Rachel in 1987 when Ross brought him home for Thanksgiving.
    He was born to Jack and Judy Geller and raised by them on Long Island, New York. He is the older brother of Monica. When Ross was younger, he dressed up as a woman (with his mother's clothes) and sang, "I am Bea / I drink tea / Won't you dance around with me?". When growing up, he attended the same high school as Rachel (as did Monica) where he eventually developed a crush on her and kept it to himself, although Rachel later admitted she knew about his crush, but didn't return those feelings. He befriended a fellow student named Will Colbert, who was frequently bullied and teased by Rachel for being fat. Dealing with the fact that she never seemed to notice his feelings for her, in a very immature way, Ross co-founded an "I-Hate-Rachel" Club with Will (and an exchange student from Thailand who had no idea what the club was for). To spite her, the two of them spread a rumor about her that everyone in the entire high school (apart from Rachel herself) heard about. The rumor in question is that she, as Ross put it, "had both male and female reproductive parts" and that, as Will put it, "her parents flipped a coin and decided to raise her as a girl." It was so wide spread even Chandler heard it in his all-boys high school. However, Rachel unknowingly returned the favor in a way after catching Ross making out with Lincoln High School's fifty-year-old librarian. She then spread a rumor regarding this all over the high school (although Ross apparently didn't know that she'd seen him doing this or that everyone in the high school knew about it until many years later).

At some point when he was 12, Ross was mugged by a 14-year-old girl (who was Phoebe). She stole his backpack, taking with her the only copy of a comic that Ross wrote, Science Boy. He only found out who the thief was decades later, though Ross tried to make Phoebe forget about it. After though, Phoebe apologized for what she did and the two made up.

After High School, he spent some time during the summer in his grandmother's apartment (Monica's) trying to make it as a dancer, something he didn't even mention to Rachel. In college, he met Chandler, and they became best friends. Chandler met Monica and Rachel in 1987 when Ross brought him home for Thanksgiving. In 1988 Ross met and fell in love with Carol Willick and over the years they got married and remained happily married for a few years, with Ross drifting apart from Rachel over time. When Carol fell in love with another woman, it came as a mentally traumatic shock for Ross which not only resulted in the culminating his divorce with her but also birthed intense levels of paranoia, insecurity, and fear in his burdened psyche. Although Rachel visits the bar (which would become Central Perk) in 1993, Rachel and Ross don't actually meet at that time.<br></h3><br> <h3 style="text-shadow: 1px 1px ghostwhite; text-position: center;
