              ">Joey comes from an Italian-American family of eight children, of which he is the only male. He is from, and presumably born in, Queens. As a child, he was extremely accident prone. In "The One With Ross' New Girlfriend", it's implied that he was sexually abused as a child by a tailor, but did not realize this until Chandler went to the same place years later. As a child, he had an imaginary friend named Maurice, who was a space cowboy. He meets most of the friends (with the exception of Rachel) as a result of being Chandler's roommate. Joey meets Rachel a while later, at Central Perk when she runs out on her planned wedding with Barry.

Joey is a stereotypical and a terrible actor: oversexed, under-educated, and constantly looking for work. He is also ordained as a minister in "The One With The Truth About London", and he officiates at both Monica and Chandler's and Phoebe and Mike's weddings. It is revealed in "The One After 'I Do'" that Joey has a size seven foot (European size 38.5), which he is secretive and defensive about. He also has a soft toy penguin named Huggsy (his "bedtime penguin pal"), which he is very fond of and does not like to share with others. In "The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin", it is revealed that as was common with Catholic boys, Joey is circumcised.
