              ">Phoebe Buffay and her twin sister, Ursula, are the result of a sexual relationship between Phoebe Abbott, Frank Buffay, and Lily Buffay. Phoebe Abbott wasn't ready to be a mother as she didn't mean to get pregnant, so Lily and Frank adopted both twins and raised them together. Frank abandoned Lily and the twins soon after, and then later married another unknown woman. The children's step-father went to prison, and Lily committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning when putting her head in an oven. Phoebe was living on her own homeless on the streets of New York City by the age of 14. When she was 18, she lived in a burnt-out Buick LeSabre. She never attended high school or college, but she met behind a dumpster with a small group of three to learn French. She became fluent in speaking it, as evidenced in "The One Where Joey Speaks French". She also speaks some Italian, and has a short conversation in Italian with Joey's grandmother, Nonnie in "The One Where Ross Can't Flirt". Her language skills are treated somewhat inconsistently. She misunderstands when one of Monica's assistant introduces himself as a sous-chef, and she does not appear to understand Rachel's Italian former boyfriend, Paolo (but neither can any of the other five friends).

Phoebe occasionally resorted to mugging to survive, something the other friends are not very familiar about. At one point, when she was 14, she mugged Ross. (This was when these future friends were still strangers). One of the stolen items was the only existing copy of Ross' comic book, Science Boy. ("The One With The Mugging")

Phoebe mentions that she lived in Prague. She also states that she lived with an albino man who washed windows outside Port Authority, as well as a, "guy named Sidney who talked to his hand." She claims that she got hepatitis, when a pimp spit in her mouth. On her sweet sixteen, she was chased around a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who, "in his own words, wanted to 'kill me or whatever." ("The One With The Home Study") In "The One In Vegas, Part 2", when Phoebe thinks the security guard is going to take her to jail, she exclaims "I'm not going back to that hell hole!" implying that she has previously been arrested or close to been arrested, likely at some point during her life living on the streets. She also alludes to this event in the uncut version of "The One With The Cop".

Her previous lifestyle and wild stories have shocked her friends. When she tells the story of the time she stabbed a cop, their obviously surprised looks cause her to retort, "What? He stabbed me first!" Phoebe has picked up an impressive talent for boxing at a YMCA, where, according to her, the guys, "weren't being Christian enough." ("The One With The Race Car Bed") Phoebe met and moved in with Monica, which began their friendship. While still living with her, Phoebe was married to a gay Canadian ice dancer, Duncan, in order to help him obtain a green card. At the time, Phoebe was secretly in love with him. Monica claims that when Duncan left, she saw Phoebe eating a cheeseburger. Years later, Duncan returns unexpectedly to request a divorce from Phoebe because he has realized that he isn't really gay, and that he is in love with a woman. In 1993, Phoebe, not being able to take Monica's obsessive neatness, started to secretly move out. She moved her furniture piece by piece into her grandmother's apartment.
